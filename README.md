# Clutter.rs #

These are bindings for the Clutter library usable from Rust, they are quite high-level bindings generated from the rsi-file `clutter.xml`.

If you find a bug, please report it so I can fix it.

If you can fix it yourself, a pull request would make me very happy too, in that case, remember that the clutter.rs file is generated, so you have to either fix rsi or the xml-files in this repository.
